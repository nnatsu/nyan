[Description]
 - fg # (without '%' before #) foregrounds said job.
 - fg alone foregrounds last backgrounded job.

 - bg, kill, kill -9 all work the same as fg

 - jobs prints a list of running/suspended jobs
   - terminated jobs are removed from the list

 - ctrl-z suspends current foreground job

 - two sets of pointers in each job struct. One set takes care of
   managing the list of jobs. The other takes care of the order of
   backgrounding each job.

[Bugs]
 - ; adds a redundant job ";" to the list
 - shell prints "bad input" when it shouldn't from time to time
 - memory leaks
   - freed jobs as they are terminated and deleted from list
   - still others

[Other (Not Included)]
 - Piping hangs the shell when there are multiple pipes involved.
